This is a project for data visualization I, an optional class of my career. It is about drawing fractals on the screen.
After i finished with 3 fractals I made my own equation called "Carolina".
The executable file is inside the folder "dist" and the source code is inside the foulder "src".

To use it please click the button "cargar fractal", then choose a color from the palette and the fractal you want to draw.
